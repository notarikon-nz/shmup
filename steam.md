# TIDAL POOL COSMOS

**Dive into the microscopic frontier. Evolution is your weapon.**

## About This Game

When cosmic spores crash into an alien tidal pool, an ancient microscopic civilization awakens to defend their world. Pilot evolved microorganisms through breathtaking underwater battlefields where every current, pH shift, and oxygen pocket becomes a tactical advantage.

Tidal Pool Cosmos combines classic shoot-em-up intensity with unique biological mechanics. Fight through translucent enemies in flowing, ever-changing environments where the ecosystem itself is your battlefield.

## Key Features

**EVOLUTIONARY COMBAT**
Collect genetic upgrades that fundamentally change your organism. Grow flagella for speed, develop photosynthesis for energy regeneration, or strengthen your cell wall for defense. Every evolution opens new tactical possibilities.

**LIVING ENVIRONMENTS** 
Navigate dynamic underwater currents, exploit chemical zones, and ride oxygen streams. The microscopic world flows around you - use tidal forces to outmaneuver enemies or push them into hostile environments.

*[SCREENSHOT 3: Scale-shifting moment - zooming from open water combat into the interior of a larger organism]*

**SCALE-SHIFTING BATTLES**
Seamlessly fight from the open water down to cellular interiors. Battle viral swarms in blood vessels, navigate the neural pathways of corrupted sea life, and face cosmic horrors that exist across multiple scales simultaneously.

**ECOSYSTEM WARFARE**
Your actions ripple through the biological web. Destroy algae to starve herbivores, create acid clouds from fallen enemies, or form temporary symbiotic alliances with other enhanced microbes.

## Story

A crystalline spore from deep space has infected the tidal pools, turning a delicate microscopic ecosystem into a transmission array for something vast and hungry. As part of an ancient biological defense network, you must evolve, adapt, and fight through increasingly complex organisms to prevent a cosmic-scale infection.

Navigate three acts spanning from simple bacterial combat to reality-warping encounters with entities that exist simultaneously at molecular and planetary scales.
