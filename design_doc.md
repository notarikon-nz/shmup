# **Game Design Document: Tidal Pool Cosmos**

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2025
**Project:** Tidal Pool Cosmos
**Lead Designer:** Matt Orsborn (Notarikon)
**Status:** In Development

---

## **1. High Concept**

A microscopic shoot-'em-up where players pilot an evolving microorganism through a living, breathing alien tidal pool ecosystem. Combat is defined by biological and environmental mechanics like fluid dynamics, pH levels, and oxygen stratification, as players battle a cosmic infection to save their world and prevent a galactic catastrophe.

## **2. Core Pillars**

1.  **Biological Warfare:** Every game mechanic is rooted in a real or speculative biological concept (pH, osmosis, symbiosis, evolution).
2.  **Living Environment:** The world is not a static backdrop but a dynamic, flowing, and reactive battlefield that is both an obstacle and a weapon.
3.  **Seamless Scale:** The player's sense of perspective is a core gameplay feature, shifting from microscopic to cellular and back.
4.  **Evolving Protagonist:** The player's growth from a simple bacterium into a unique cosmic guardian is the core progression loop.

## **3. Core Gameplay Loop**

1.  **Navigate** a level using current-based movement.
2.  **Combat** corrupted microorganisms and navigate environmental hazards.
3.  **Collect** genetic material and energy from defeated enemies and the environment.
4.  **Evolve** between or during levels by purchasing new biological upgrades.
5.  **Adapt** strategy to the level's unique tidal, chemical, and seasonal conditions.
6.  **Complete** the level objective (destroy all enemies, defeat a boss, survive, etc.).
7.  **Progress** the story and unlock new zones and abilities.

## **4. The Player Character & Evolution (Power-ups)**

The player starts as a basic, customizable microbe. Progression is achieved by permanently acquiring evolutionary traits.
