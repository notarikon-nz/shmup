# Tidal Pool Cosmos

**Dive into the microscopic frontier. Evolution is your weapon.**

*Tidal Pool Cosmos* is an underwater shoot-'em-up where you pilot an evolving microorganism through a living, breathing alien ecosystem. Battle a cosmic infection using the environment itselfâ€”ride dynamic currents, exploit chemical warfare, and shift scales from open water to cellular interiors.

## Features

-   **Evolutionary Combat:** Permanently upgrade your microbe with biological traits like flagella for speed, photosynthesis for energy, and reinforced cell walls for defense.
-   **Living Environment:** Master a battlefield defined by realistic fluid dynamics, real-time pH zones, and oxygen stratification. Push enemies into acidic clouds or ride oxygen streams to safety.
-   **Seamless Scale-Shifting:** Zoom from epic battles in the open water to intense combat inside the bloodstream of larger corrupted organisms.
-   **Ecosystem Warfare:** Your actions have consequences. Destabilize the food web to gain tactical advantages or form temporary symbiotic alliances with other microbes.
-   **Rich Game Modes:** Dive into a 30+ level Campaign, survive endless waves in Tidal Rush, merge abilities in co-op Symbiosis mode, or test your skills in the challenge-based Laboratory.

## Development

This project is built with **Rust** and **Bevy**.

### Key Technical Features

-   **Custom Fluid Dynamics:** A physics-based system simulates water currents that affect all entities.
-   **Real-time Simulation:** Interconnected systems for pH, oxygen, and tidal cycles.
-   **Advanced Shaders:** Custom shaders for translucent organic visuals, bioluminescence, and water refraction.
-   **State-Driven AI:** Enemies use state machines to react dynamically to the player and environment.
